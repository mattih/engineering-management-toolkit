# Engineering Management Toolkit

This repository is a collection of resources to jumpstart engineering management in your team or a new organization. It includes tools to facilitate operations and monitor developer experience. As there are as many management styles as there are managers, the resources are heavily opinionated by the author's preferences. The core philosophy of my management style is based on:

- **Great Developer Experience**: Enabling the team to do their best work by reducing friction and removing obstacles
- **One to one coaching**: Identifying team member strengths and playing into them
- **Ownership and empathy**: Guiding the team to take ownership and have empathy for the end users

These values guide the content of this repository.

## How this repository is structured

The resources in this repository are arranged into the following sections:

4. [Quality and Standards](./04-Quality-and-Standards)
5. [Hiring Engine](./05-Hiring-Engine)

### Developer Experience and Wellbeing

Developer experience is the user experience of the engineering organization. In my opinion, a great organization is founded in a strong developer experience and fosters wellbeing of its employees. Without a culture like this engineers will jump ship in no time, as there are organizations that aim for a great developer experience and take care of their people. This is why an engineering leader needs to pay great attention to it. This section includes surveys and dashboards to monitor the sentiment of your engineers.
