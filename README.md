# Engineering Management Toolkit

This repository is a codification of my engineering philosophy. It is designed to reduce organizational latency, automate culture, and align technical output with business value. I've included tools I've used to facilitate operations and monitor developer experience. As there are as many management styles as there are managers, the resources are heavily opinionated by the author's preferences. The core philosophy of my management style is based on:

- **DevEx enabled Velocity**: Enabling the team to do their best work by reducing friction and removing obstacles.
- **Tailored coaching**: Identifying team member strengths and playing into them. My goal is to coach teams to the point where they operate autonomously.
- **Product-minded Engineers**: Guiding the team to take ownership and have empathy for the end users. Everyone needs to know the "Why".

These values guide the content of this repository.

The resources in this repository are arranged into the following sections:

### Developer Experience and Wellbeing

Developer experience is the user experience of the engineering organization. In my opinion, a great organization is founded in a strong developer experience and fosters wellbeing of its employees. Without a culture like this engineers will jump ship in no time, as there are organizations that aim for a great developer experience and take care of their people. This is why an engineering leader needs to pay great attention to it. This section includes surveys and dashboards to monitor the sentiment of your engineers.
