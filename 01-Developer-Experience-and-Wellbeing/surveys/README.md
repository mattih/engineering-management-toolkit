# Quarterly Pulse Survey

This survey is designed to capture the sentiment of your engineering team about the workplace, processes and tooling. It is simple and infrequent by design, as too long of a questionnaire would not be filled out by people.

## Question breakdown

The questionnaire includes seven questions

1. **I would recommend this team as a great place to work.**
  - Why: This question measures the Net Promoter Score (NPS) of your team. NPS is a common way to measure generic user experience, and can be used in this context as well.
  - What to look for: Besides the average, look for outliers. Even a couple of negative sentiments can easily spread to the whole team, and should be discussed early.

2. **I can deploy code to production without fear of breaking things.**
  - Why: This question measures trust in our CI/CD pipeline, as well as testing and review practices. If there is fear, the engineers might stall with changes.
  - What to look for: Average and standard deviation together. If we have a large deviation, we might have knowledge silos in place.

3. **I have significant blocks of uninterrupted time ("Flow State") to write code.**
  - Why: Flow state is one of, if not the most important, predictor of developer productivity.
  - What to look for:

4. **Our tools (IDE, CI, Jira) help me work faster rather than slowing me down.**
  - Why: 
  - What to look for:

5. **Using AI tools (e.g., Copilot) allowed me to focus on higher-level problem solving this quarter.**
  - Why: 
  - What to look for:

6. **I felt exhausted or "drained" at the end of most workdays this quarter.**
  - Why: 
  - What to look for:

7. If you could wave a magic wand and fix ONE thing about our engineering workflow (process, tech, or people), what would it be?
  - Why: 
  - What to look for:
