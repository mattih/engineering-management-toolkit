# One-to-one meetings

One-to-one meetings are there for the team member to get your undivided attention. **The goal is to improve operational excellence as well as manage your people.** The meetings might mostly concern three topic categories:

- **Everyday work**: These are tactical level matters that let your team member immediately proceed with their current work. Ideally blockers would be solved as soon as they arise, but sometimes they carry over to one-to-ones.
- **Career growth**: The career progression and strategic matters concerning the particular team member. You might not know everything about the skills your team member wants to master or the role they want to grow in (and you shouldn't), but you'll make sure to find out and coach them on the way.
- **Well-being and personal matters**: Software engineering is a high demand career, and taking care of the people is one of your most important duties. Sometimes there are also personal matters that you as a manager should be aware of, and you should be available to discuss and provide support.

Most of the time the topics are up to the team member, and it's your job as a leader to offer the platform.

**One-to-ones are not a status meeting.** Status updates should happen asynchronously, freeing up valuable one-to-one time for higher leverage discussions, such as career growth, emotional wellbeing, and unblocking complex problems.

## Frequency of one-to-ones

The frequency of one to ones **depends on the team member.** One size does not fit all. I would offer these options to the team members:

- Weekly (30 minutes): Best for junior engineers and new hires
- Every two weeks (45 minutes to an hour): Standard protocol for most team members that allows meaningful progress to happen before the next meeting.
- Monthly (30 to 60 minutes): Only recommended for skip-level one-to-ones if you have them. For direct reports the frequency is too low to keep connected.

## Content of one-to-ones

The content of these meetings would ideally be set by the team member, but sometimes that will not be the case. In these situations, you as the manager could get the ball rolling with some of these questions:

### Well-being

- *"What’s the most draining part of your week right now?"*
- *"Have there been any moments recently when you felt being in flow?"*
- *"How is your energy level compared to last month?"*

### Everyday work

- *"Have you recently had to make technical compromises you are not comfortable shipping?"*
- *"Who on the team is carrying too much load right now?"*
- *"Are there any blockers or inconveniences I could help solve for you?"*

### Career growth
- *"What is a skill you want to master by the end of the year?"*
- *"Are we utilizing your strengths, or are you just filling gaps?"*
- *"What's your long-term career plan? Are you looking to develop into a managerial role or as an individual contributor?"*
