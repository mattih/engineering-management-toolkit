# One-to-one meetings

One-to-one meetings are there for the team member to get your undivided attention. They might be used to talk about the team member's career development, current blockers or even personal matters. Most of the time the topics are up to the team member, and it's your job as a leader to offer the platform.

**One-to-ones are not a status meeting.**

## Frequency of one-to-ones

The frequency of one to ones **depends on the team member.** One size does not fit all. I would offer these options to the team members:

- Weekly (more frequent and there isn't enough to discuss)
- Every two weeks (the middle ground)
- Monthly (less frequent than this and you'll lose touch)
