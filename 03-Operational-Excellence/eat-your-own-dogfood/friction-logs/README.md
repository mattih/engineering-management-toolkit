# Friction Logs: Building Empathy for the Users

Often as engineers we work in the perfect environment to use our applications. This makes us miss a lot of the pain the users might be feeling when ACTUALLY using the product in the wild.

As outlined in the level above, we should be using our own products to get a better picture of what we should improve. Friction Logs are a tool to help us think about the emotions the users might have while using the product. For example:

- "This form made me hesitant to continue as I wasn't sure what to type in this input, and there was no tooltip or anything."
- "I was nervous to click this button, as I know deleting the entry is a destructive action. I might have felt better if there was a confirmation there."
- "I got frustrated because the search wasn't returning the results I was looking for, and I had to manually scroll through the data."

We want our products to invoke less negative emotions and mske the users feel empowered. By walking through a process and filling up a friction log, we could be one step closer.
